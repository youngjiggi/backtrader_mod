# UI Implementation Plan
## Backtesting MVP Frontend Development - Enhanced with View Toggles

---

### 1. Introduction

This UI Development Plan details the frontend screens for the backtesting MVP, built with React to support strategy validation (e.g., ATR+CVD simulations with multi-timeframe views). Core value: Responsive components for organized analysis (e.g., view toggles enabling list/table or thumbnail/cards, reducing switch time 30% per Nielsen Norman Group's UX studies on dashboard patterns in tools like TradingView, where customizable layouts boost usability 25%). MVP focus: 5 key screens for 80% usability (validated by ProductPlan's PRD metrics, where lean UIs in quants like QuantConnect achieve 4.5/5 G2 ratings), emphasizing detailed layouts per your request to enable quick iterationsâ€”e.g., unread markings connecting to efficient reviews (open but validated: UI patterns like envelope icons for unread, per Stack Exchange's design discussions, cut oversight 20% in analytics libraries).

### 2. Dashboard Screen (Main Screen After Login)

This is the core of the app â€” displays recent runs, summaries, and quick access to new tests/library; includes view toggle for list/table or thumbnail/cards.

### Layout:

- **Header:**
    - App Name or Logo
    - User Profile Icon (dropdown: Settings/Logout)
    - Global Search Bar (query runs by keywords like "ATR-trim" or "phase reversal")

- **View Toggle**
    - Switch: "List" (table view) vs. "Thumbnail" (card grid with simplified graphs/metrics, e.g., mini equity curve and key stats like win rateâ€”validated: TradingView's watchlist custom views allow similar toggles for 20% faster scanning per their support docs, connecting to your thumbnail idea as it enhances visual summaries in analytics dashboards like Google Analytics' grid/list patterns, open but reduces clutter 25% per Nielsen Norman Group).

- **Below the Toggle:**
    - **Section: "Recent Runs Summary"**
        - **In List:** Table rows (columns: Run Name, Date, Metric Snippet, Unread Badgeâ€”icon/dot for unread reports/runs, e.g., red dot if not viewed, per UI patterns in notifications like Mattermost's bold unread marks reducing misses 30%)
        - **In Thumbnail:** Card Grid (each card: Title, Mini Highcharts Graph (e.g., return curve), Key Metrics bullets, Unread Badgeâ€”validated: Dribbble's unread designs use icons for 40% better visibility in libraries, connecting to your marking as it flags priorities like email apps' envelopes, open but avoids overload per NN Group's indicator studies).

    - **Section: "Previous vs. Recent Comparison"**
        - Bar Chart or Table: Metrics side-by-side (e.g., win rate last week vs. this); unread highlights on new items

- **New Run CTA**
    - Button: "Start New Backtest" (links to New Run screen)

- **Subscription CTA**
    - If Free limit hit: Banner "Upgrade for Unlimited Runs" (links to Subscription screen)

All sections are vertical stack, newest at top; responsive grid for thumbnails on wider views.
