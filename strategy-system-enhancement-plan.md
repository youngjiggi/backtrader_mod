- **Add data caching system** for performance optimization
- **Create indicator calculation engine** using technical analysis libraries

### 1.3 Enhanced Strategy Builder Interface

### 4.2 Strategy Optimization Tools
- **Parameter optimization** using genetic algorithms or grid search

## Phase 5: Data Integration & Production Readiness (Week 5-6)

### 5.1 Real Data Integration
- **Connect to market data APIs** (Polygon, Alpha Vantage, or similar)
- **Implement data validation** and error handling
- **Add data quality checks** and missing data interpolation
- **Create data update scheduling** for daily/intraday refreshes

### 5.2 Performance Optimization
- **Implement data caching** with Redis or similar
