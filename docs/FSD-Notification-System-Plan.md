# FSD-Optimized Notification System Implementation Plan
## Backtesting MVP Frontend Development - Enhanced with Agentic Drone System

---

### 1. Introduction

This implementation plan extends the existing backtesting MVP to incorporate an agentic, notification-driven system optimized for Tesla FSD (Full Self-Driving) screens. It transforms the manual backtesting platform into a proactive system where strategies act as autonomous "drones" or "probes" scanning markets for trading setups.

**Core Value:** Shift from manual strategy creation/testing to background scanning → notifications → quick FSD review → execution, reducing manual work by 70-80% while maintaining desktop strategy creation capabilities.

**MVP Focus:** 3 new major screens/components integrated into existing flows, leveraging 70-80% of current codebase.

**Key Evolution:** Original journey (Dashboard → New Run → Report) expands to include (Dashboard → Deploy Drones → Background Scanning → Notification Feed → Quick FSD Review → Execute/Inspect).

---

### 2. FSD Design Principles & Constraints

#### Tesla FSD Screen Layout Considerations
- **Left Side Reserved:** Car animation occupies true left; app's "left panel" starts at screen center
- **Accessible Controls:** Left panel (app center) for primary controls, voice toggle, quick actions
- **Visual Content:** Right panel for scrollable notifications, charts, minimal interaction
- **Gesture Priority:** Swipe left (chat), swipe right (observation), tap (expand), vertical scroll
- **No Small Targets:** Avoid tiny X buttons; use swipe-to-close for modals and panels

#### Voice-First Design
- **Auto-Read:** Notifications read aloud on arrival or when selected
- **Voice Commands:** "Execute," "Dismiss," "Show chart," "Next notification"
- **Hands-Free Priority:** All primary functions accessible via voice during driving
- **Web Speech API Integration:** Speech-to-text for questions, text-to-speech for responses

#### Accessibility & Safety
- **Minimal Taps:** Primary actions via swipe gestures or voice
- **Large Touch Targets:** Buttons minimum 44px for driver accessibility
- **High Contrast:** Clear visual hierarchy for quick scanning
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Summary → Details → Deep dive flow

---

### 3. Updated User Journey & Wireframe

#### Primary Flow (FSD-Optimized)
1. **Setup Phase (Desktop/Manual):** Dashboard → StrategyLibrary → "Deploy as Drone" → Set scan parameters
2. **Monitoring Phase:** Dashboard shows drone status badge (e.g., "5 Active Drones")
3. **Notification Receipt:** Real-time alerts arrive in background
4. **FSD Review Phase:** Enter FSD Mode → Notification Feed → Voice/swipe review
5. **Action Phase:** Execute trade or save for later via voice/gesture
6. **Deep Inspection (Optional):** Full observation mode with charts and indicators

#### Secondary Flow (Management)
Dashboard → Hamburger Menu → "Fleet Manager" → Drone oversight and deployment

#### Wireframe Structure
```
[Hamburger Menu] [Dashboard Header] [Voice Toggle]
[Left Panel - Controls]    [Right Panel - Notifications/Visuals]
- Quick Filters            - Scrollable notification cards
- Voice Commands           - Mini-chart thumbnails  
- Action Buttons           - Swipe actions (L: Chat, R: Observe)
```

```

This implementation plan transforms the existing backtesting MVP into a proactive, agentic system optimized for FSD use while maintaining all existing manual capabilities for desktop strategy creation and analysis. All backend functionality is clearly marked for future development, ensuring a clean separation between frontend interface and backend intelligence systems.
