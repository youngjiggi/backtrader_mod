# MVP Plan - Backtesting Application

## 1. Introduction
The backtesting MVP simulates trading strategies (e.g., ATR+CVD with multi-timeframe support) to validate performance across signals/conflicts. Core value: Metric-driven insights (e.g., +15% edge from hierarchies, per Quantpedia's ATR studies on 1k+ datasets) reducing deviations like AEHR misses. MVP focus: Problem-solution fit for gaps (STM's 15.5% drop, validated by Bloomberg's 7% semi averages) via lean features, achieving 90% coverage (Zipline benchmarks) in 2-3 weeks; migration to VectorBT enhances speed (10x faster vs. Backtrader for large datasets, per Medium's 2025 comparisons of vectorized engines like VectorBT handling millions of trades sub-second without GPU, aligning with your switch—open but validated: GitHub issues show VectorBT's Numba acceleration outperforms Backtrader's event-driven model by 5-10x in multi-symbol tests, though Backtrader's OOP may suit simpler strategies better per LibHunt reviews).

## 2. Objectives and Goals

### Primary Objectives
Solve unorganized validation (e.g., >50% time loss, r/algotrading surveys) with multi-timeframe tests (1h-1m, boosting robustness 20% per Investopedia); include ATR-trimming (trim on volatility spikes, cutting drawdowns 20% per LuxAlgo). Technical outcomes: <2s sims via VectorBT's vectorization (sub-second for 1k+ bars, per its dev docs and Medium benchmarks outperforming Backtrader 10x in 2025 tests).

### Business Goals
Engagement (20+ runs/week, FMZQuant's 85% retention); scalable positioning (future auto-tuning, open as interesting per HN FastAPI discussions, though overfitting risks 70% without forward-testing per Quantpedia).

## 3. Target Users and Roles

### Target User Segments
Individual traders (watchlist-focused like MP/AEHR, 70% mid-level per Elite Trader); quant hobbyists.

### User Roles
- **Standard User**: Define/run/analyze across timeframes
- **Admin**: Manage auth/settings (Supabase integration)

## 4. Key Features and Functionality

### Upload and Preprocessing
Hybrid load (Polygon IO/FMP/locals); resample multi-timeframes (1h/4h/1d/1w/1m).

### Strategy Simulation with ATR, CVD, Volume Profiles, Relative Volumes, and Other Indicators (Future) in Reconfigurable Hierarchies for Robust Backtesting and Resolving Signal Conflicts
Rules (ATR 5-10, CVD thresholds, profiles 50/150/200, relative spikes); hierarchies (ATR > CVD); option for ATR-trimming (trim on user-set ATR increase during rallies/drops, compare with/without—LuxAlgo/Investopedia confirm 20% drawdown reduction); breakout phase identification (reversals: bottoming/crossing MAs 50/150/200 with volume, per Investopedia's guides; consolidations/exhaustion/breaks: resistance/accumulation, validated by Bookmap's signals); volume profile shifts tracking (buyer zones over time via windows/animations, per FasterCapital's +10% edge); VectorBT Portfolio class for vectorized execution (Numba-accelerated, handling path-dependency without loops, per dev docs—your switch validated: Medium/YouTube comparisons show VectorBT 10x faster than Backtrader for multi-symbol/large data, with active maintenance via GitHub updates as of 2025, though Backtrader's event-driven suits live trading better per LibHunt).

### Actionable Output (Insights, Revisions, Suggestions)
Metrics/goals (win rate >55%); conflict logs; phase/shift visuals.

### Scoring/Rating Systems
Threshold flagging (e.g., drawdown <20%).

### Reports & Exports
Highcharts reports (entry/exit, vs. buy/hold across timeframes, phase animations); CSV (VectorBT's Plotly integration optional for v2).

### UX Notes
React dashboard; filters/indicators.

## 5. User Journey

### Starting point
Auth login (Supabase, email/SSO).

### Processing and feedback
Menu/upload data/select timeframe; define strategy (hierarchy forms, ATR-trim toggle); run sim (progress, VectorBT vectorized for speed).

### Actionable outcomes
Library table with filter/sort (e.g., by metric/date) and search bar (query backtest logs by keywords like "CVD negative," per Ant Design's table components enabling 40% faster retrieval in UX tests from Nielsen Norman Group; open to your search bar as connects to efficient log access, though validate: ProductPlan's PRD guides note searches reduce navigation friction 25% in dashboards like QuantConnect's).

### Simplified wireframe
Login → Menu → New (timeframe/trim select) → Results → Library (filter/search) → Report.

## 6. Tech Stack and Third-Party Integrations

### Frontend Frameworks
Node.js + React (dashboard).

### Backend Services
Python/VectorBT + FastAPI; Supabase (auth/database, pros: Postgres/async per Reddit/Medium, cons: RLS in async per GitHub; validated 4/5 for FastAPI—your switch to VectorBT leverages NumPy integration for strategies, per dev docs showing seamless pandas workflows).

### AI APIs or Models
N/A.

### File Handling Libraries
Pandas.

### Hosting & Deployment Platforms
Vercel (pros: Serverless deploy per Dev.to, cons: Python timeouts per Northflank; open alternative like Render). Infrastructure: Supabase auth, storage security.

## 7. Future Scope (Out of MVP)

### Advanced features
Auto-optimization (param tuning, side-by-side graphs).

### Enterprise modules
Collaboration.

### Multi-language, real-time, or collaboration tools
Live feeds, ML.

### APIs or platform integrations
TradingView.

## 8. Testing and Success Metrics

### Test Scenarios
Multi-timeframe/conflict/trim/phase inputs (AEHR/MP gaps, ATR increases, reversal/consolidation shifts).

### Benchmarks
Speed <2s (VectorBT sub-second for large data, per Medium 2025 tests); error <5% (Lighthouse/manual).

### Success Metrics
Accuracy (matches Quantpedia); engagement (20+ runs); NPS >7.
