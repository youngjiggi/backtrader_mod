# Backtrader Full-Stack Development Game Plan

## Project Overview
Transform the existing backtrader Python library into a modern full-stack backtesting application with frontend UI and backend API integration.

## Current State
- ✅ Core backtrader library codebase
- ✅ Custom backtesting example (`backtest_test.py`)
- ✅ Virtual environment with dependencies (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
- ✅ Git repository initialized and pushed to GitHub

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Planning & Documentation
**Status: In Progress**
- [x] Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- [ ] MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Plan
- [x] UI Implementation Plan
- [ ] Frontend codebase integration

### Phase 2: Frontend Development
**Status: Not Started**
- [ ] Frontend codebase setup and integration
- [ ] UI implementation based on design plans
- [ ] Frontend backtesting interface
- [ ] Data visualization components
- [ ] User interaction flows

### Phase 3: Backend Development  
**Status: Not Started**
- [ ] API design and architecture
- [ ] Data integration APIs
- [ ] Backend services for backtesting engine
- [ ] Database design and implementation
- [ ] Authentication and user management

### Phase 4: Integration & Core Features
**Status: Not Started**
- [ ] Frontend-backend integration
- [ ] Real-time data feeds
- [ ] Advanced backtesting features
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Testing and quality assurance

## Key Components

### Frontend
- Modern web interface for backtesting
- Interactive charts and visualizations
- Strategy builder/editor
- Results dashboard
- Portfolio management

### Backend
- RESTful API for backtesting operations
- Data ingestion and management
- Real-time market data integration
- Strategy execution engine
- Results storage and retrieval

### Core Features (Planned)
- Strategy backtesting and optimization
- Multiple data source integration
- Real-time market data
- Portfolio analytics
- Risk management tools
- Performance reporting

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Receive and review PRD *(completed)*
2. ✅ Receive UI implementation plan *(completed)*
3. Receive MVP plan
4. Integrate provided frontend codebase
5. Begin frontend development according to specifications
6. Proceed with backend development after frontend completion

## Notes
- Development approach: Frontend-first, then backend
- Focus on MVP features initially
- Iterative development with regular testing
- Maintain compatibility with existing backtrader core functionality
