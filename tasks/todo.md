### ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

**Successfully delivered a minimal, lean frontend with:**

1. **Single-Page Dashboard Design**: Implemented information hierarchy with expandable sections instead of multiple routes
2. **Dual Theme System**: Dark/light mode with cyan (#00d4ff/#0099cc) and glacier blue (#87ceeb/#4682b4) accent colors
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Collapsible sections for Recent Runs, Performance Overview, and Strategy Library
4. **Clean Component Architecture**: 
   - Reusable `CollapsibleSection` component
   - Theme-aware styling with CSS custom properties
   - Modal system for complex forms

### üéØ Key Features Implemented

- **Theme Toggle**: Persistent dark/light mode with smooth transitions
- **Metrics Dashboard**: 6 key performance cards with trend indicators
- **Multi-Step Modal**: New Backtest form with validation and progress steps
- **Search Integration**: Global search bar in header
- **Responsive Grid**: Metrics cards adapt to screen size
- **Unread Indicators**: Badge system for new/unseen content

### üì± Technical Decisions

- **Single Page App**: Avoided complex routing for faster development
- **CSS Variables**: Easy theme switching without component rebuilds  
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety for component props and state
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only essential packages (React, Vite, Tailwind, Lucide)

### üöÄ Ready for Development

The frontend is ready for `npm install && npm run dev`. All core functionality is implemented with a clean, scannable interface that follows the minimal UI principles requested.
